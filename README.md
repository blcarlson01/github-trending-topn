# github-trending-topn
Parses the github-trending and creates a top n list (default: top 200)

This tool aggregates the unique results from blcarlson01/github-trending into a list of the Top 200 Open Source Java Projects.  The tool works similar to blcarlson01/github-trending as it uses travis-ci to run the build process once a day to update the list of 200 and then uses the deployment feature to publish the results.
